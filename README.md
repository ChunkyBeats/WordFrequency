Word Frequency

This app takes two inputs.  One is a string defined by the user, and the
other is a key word, also user defined.  The app will scan the string
for the number of times the key word is present, and output that number
to the screen.  If no input was defined for either the string, or key word, it
will not run, and tell the user that one of the entries was blank.

This was created using Ruby v2.2.2.

It requires the use of the Ruby gems: sinatra, sinatra-contrib, rspec, and
Capybara.  They can be found through https://rubygems.org.
Install them by setting your current directory to the parent folder for
word_freq and creating a Gemfile for them.  After, type the following line
into the command line:

$ bundle install

Licenses include MIT license and GPL v2.
